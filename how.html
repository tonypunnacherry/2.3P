<h2>Proposed Legislation</h2>
<p>The following are things we can do the address the needs of immigrants as a nation:</p>
<ul>
<li>Worker's rights and wage protections</li>
<li>Health Care</li>
<li>Sancutary policies</li>
<li>Repealing HB2315 and HB2312</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
<h2>Bipartisan Support</h2>
<p>Instead of continuing to send migrants to other states, show that the other side are the ones that don't care!</p>
<p>You can earn future potential voters and support of centrists who are divided on this issue without compromising the integrity of your party.</p>
